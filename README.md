# Customs Simulation

A web-based simulation for Border and Transportation Security students to practice customs interviews.

## How It Works

Students play the role of a customs officer. They are presented with a randomized traveler profile and must ask questions to uncover red flags, visa issues, or contraband attempts.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/import) to easily deploy this Vite-based app directly from your GitHub repository.
